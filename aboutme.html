            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Charryl Subrio, and I am a 19-year-old tech enthusiast. I am an aspiring programmer who is eager to learn and grow in the field.</p>
            <p>My journey in tech began at age 10, when I helped my older brother run our family's internet cafe. I learned how to build, upgrade, and troubleshoot PCs.</p>
            <p>In junior high, I enrolled in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), where I learned Ethernet cable termination and network architectures. In senior high, I took Computer Systems Servicing (CSS), which expanded my knowledge of networks.</p>
            <p>During my work immersion at Advance Monitoring & Security Systems, Inc. (AMSSI), I learned how to terminate coaxial cable, install CCTV, and set up DVR and NVR.</p>    
            <p>After graduating from senior high school, I was hired by AMSSI as a part-time CCTV installer. I also upgraded our family's internet cafe to a diskless setup, building the server, installing the NOS, and setting up the diskless system software remotely.</p>    
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Holy Name University, where I am learning C language programming, HTML5, and CSS. I am continuously expanding my skillset by taking online programming courses to deepen my expertise in network administration, programming, and web development. I am particularly interested in exploring the realm of machine learning and its potential applications.</p>    
            <p>I am eager to learn and grow, and I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that technology has the potential to solve some of the world's biggest problems, and I'm excited to be a part of that.</p>
